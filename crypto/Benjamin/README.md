## Description

No! Not that Franklin!

Author's note: This is an Introduction to an advanced type RSA attack, that being said, please don't feel intimidated to give this challenge a try. Since the plain type of this attack is already quite common, there are a lot of implementation of this attack already on the internet, that's why I slightly increase the complexity to make sure participants did not just copy and paste the code they found online to solve this challenge

## Difficulty
hard

## Hints
> Intentionally left empty

## Tags
RSA

## Solve
Franklin Reiter related message attack, bisa pakai [script umum](https://github.com/ashutosh1206/Crypton/blob/master/RSA-encryption/Attack-Franklin-Reiter/exploit.sage), tetapi harus dimodifikasi sedikit sesuai dengan manipulasinya
